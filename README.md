# theme-stylesheet
An experimental [divsoup](https://www.hackterms.com/div%20soup)-style implementation of the theme. Not as simple to consume as the web components version, but possibly easier to use in some cases.

**NO SUPPORT IS GUARANTEED FOR THIS REPO**.  It is not (yet) an official web community-supported product, it's a thing Joseph made one day when he was at home sick, bored out of his mind.
